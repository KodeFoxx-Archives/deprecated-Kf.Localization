## Documentation ##
This is coming. Meanwhile, please review the tests for the best examples on how to use.

## Download ##
- Main library at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kf.Localization/
- Resx based implementation at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kf.Localization.Resx/

## Resx Example ##
1. Download the binaries Kf.Localization and Kf.Localization.Resx, or get all dependencies directly via the nuget package ( https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kf.Localization.Resx/ ).
2. Create the appropriate .resx files (e.g. Strings.resx, Strings.nl-BE.resx, Strings.en-EN.resx, etc..)
3. Afterwards you can use the library, and pass around the dependendent object via DI or any other method you prefer.
